## 
This is a CodeBook for the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project, as a part of request: GitHub contains a code book that modifies and updates the available codebooks with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

The relevant Data can be found at the URL in the run_analysis.R script.

The following steps have been conducted on the data:

Merging of the training and the test sets in order to create one merged ("merged") data set. The files (reading, testing, feaute, activity label) are first read to the R, and assigned to appropriately named tables. The data was then merged. Vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation has been created, and needed subset from "merged" was formed Everything was labeled appropriately and an independent tidy data set was formed and written to an independentTidySet as a txt file.
