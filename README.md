# Getting-and-cleaning-data-Maja
This is a part of of Coursera's Getting and Cleaning Data second course project, where it is needed to create a tidy set out of an utidy one. The data itself is the data from an activity tracker.

This repository consist of several files, that being:

README.md, which provides an overview the repository and the project,
CodeBook.md, the code book, which contains the info about the files and the process,
run_analysis.R, the script used for the transformation, and
independentTidySet.txt, the final output.
